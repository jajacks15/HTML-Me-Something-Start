         <h2>Context</h2>
         <p> <em>One Piece</em> is the story of a pirate boy named Monkey D. Luffy. Luffy's goal is to gather a pirate
            crew who will help him sail the seas of the Grand Line and ultimately find the One Piece, the treasure left
            behind by the king of the pirates - Gol D. Roger. Doing so would make Luffy the new kiong of the pirates and
            help him achieve his dream, but the Grand Line is a harsh sea which presents many difficult challenges to
            Luffy. Luffy has since collected his crew-- the Strawhat Pirates-- and they are taking the Grand Line by
            storm.</p>
         <p>Leading up to the Wano-kuni arc, Luffy and the Straw-hat pirates have made quite a name for themselves. They
            have visited uncharted territories, liberated countries that have been terrorized by pirates identified by
            the World Government as &quot;Warlords of the Sea&quot;, they've learned a bit about the history of the
            world they live in, and they've even picked a fight with two of the pirates who hold the title of "The Four
            Emperors of the Sea". Luffy is a member of a young group of new pirates who are making big waves in the
            Grand Line, called &quot;The Worst Generation&quot;. He has formed an alliance with one of the members of
            that group, named Trafalger Law, to take down King of the Beasts, Kaido, one of the four Emperors. On the
            island that they form the alliance with Law and his pirate group, the Heart Pirates, the Straw Hat crew
            meets two strange samurai-- a man named Kin'emon and a young child named Momonosuke who join the crew's
            adventure in hopes of finding their samurai friends who they've been separated from. They eventually reunite
            with their lost samurai friends and learn that they share the common goal of defeating Kaido in their home
            country, Wano.<br><br> The groups set sail to Wano, determined to bring down Emperor Kaido, but there is
            also an important second goal, to find a missing piece of the map to the One Piece, which Luffy and his crew
            are ever so close to finding. Will they achieve their goals of defeating Kaido and finding the missing
            piece?? </p>

         </p>
         <p>As Luffy lands on the shores of Wano and meets a young girl named Otama, nicknamed &quot;Tama&quot;. Through
            Tama, Luffy learns that the once beautiful land of Wano has been diminished to an enfamished wasteland with
            poisoned waters by Kaido. The only place in Wano that has kept its former glory is the Flower Capital, which
            is where the evil new shogun, Orochi lives.</p>

         <p>Because Tama gives Luffy the only rice that she gets to eat in the entire year, Luffy vows to defeat Kaido
            no matter what to restore Wano back to what it was. Luffy and his crew learns that Kin&apos;emon and his
            samurai companions travelled from 20 years in the past to challenge Kaido to a decisive battle with the
            remaining samurai in his group that are scattered across Wano. Despite learning that Kaido can transform
            into a dragon, Luffy challenges Kaido to a one-on-one duel but loses badly and is thrown in jail.</p>

            Momonosuke is the son of Kozuki Oden, the former shogun of Wano. Momnonosuke will rule as the new shogun
            should they defeat Kaido. Kin'emon eventually meets up with the remaining samurai in his group and the team
            prepares to set sail towads Kaido and challenge him to take back Wano.</p>

            one of the samurai and he helps Luffy defeat Kaido. Orochi is also defeated and Momonosuke is able to take

         <h3>Story Implications</h3>
         <p>Upon defeating Kaido and Big Mom-- another Emperor who followed Luffy into Wano-- Luffy has been named as
            one of the new Four Emperors. The Straw Hats also find the missing piece of the missing map to the One
            Piece. There is now one piece (no pun intended) of the map that the crew needs in order to finally locate
            the king of the pirates' treasure. </p>
